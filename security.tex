\section{Security}

At the first sight we inherit most of the flaws of the PoS
approaches. However, this hybrid solution allows us to use the parent chain as a
reliable protector against most of attacks that target the PoS systems.

\subsection{Nothing at stake}

Nothing at stake is actually non-existent problem for hyperchains, as the shape
of the child chain is determined by the shape of the parent which is free of
this issue. The microforks can be easily treated by regular slashing solutions
that we know from BitcoinNG.

\subsection{Stake grinding}

Since the RNG depends finally on the keyblock hash on the PoW hash it is
impossible to predict the final outcome. One could try to mine the parent chain
in a special way, but this would require so much computational power that in
most cases it would be easier just to take the control over it by some 51\%
attack.

\subsection{Long range attack}
While it is still possible to perform it, it would be impossible to do it in a
silence and without preparation since the very beginning. The commitments
guarantee that the information of the delegates is stored on a immutable chain
and one would need to announce their will of mining some suspicious blocks during
the full period of the attack. This would easily expose the will of the attacker
and would let the others prepare for eventual surprise (by for example
blacklisting them).
