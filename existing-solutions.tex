\section{Existing solutions}

In this section, we describe the existing approaches to the problem along
with the problems they face and how they attempt to address them.

\subsection{Proof of Work}

Proof of Work (or shortly PoW) solves the problem of decision making by forcing the
users (here called miners) to solve some hard computational puzzle to validate
(here, mine) blocks\cite{bitcoin}.
The point is to make it hard to dominate the network by a
single selfish entity. This solution works as long as nobody holds over 50\% of the whole
computational power, in which case they could just fork the chain at any point
and get ahead of the main history line. This is a serious issue since in most
protocols the most difficult chain is considered the proper one. Therefore one needs a
lot of participants in the network to make it reasonably safe. Moreover, this
solution leads to extreme waste of energy and huge costs — according to some
measurements, the whole blockchain environment burns enough energy to power
the whole Denmark\cite{bitcoin_energy}.

This idea does not scale well — it is almost impossible to create a public
network from scratch that would not eventually be dominated by some malicious
entity. A lot of existing serious blockchains suffer this problem
\cite{51attack}. On the other hand, a network becomes extremely secure once
it is popular enough.

\subsection{Proof of Stake}

While PoW distributes the leadership based on computational power, PoS does it
based on so–called stake, which in most cases means token supply, sometimes
with additional tweaks\cite{peercoin}\cite{cryptocurr_without_pow}.
The idea is to create a leadership voting system
which is activated periodically. Each time an election event occurs,
the new leader is randomly selected from the stakeholders (called delegates).
The chance of winning an election is proportional to the size of one's stake.
This approach does
not imply any noticeable energetic overhead and therefore is much more friendly to the
environment. It also does not require users to have powerful computers to be able to
have some involvement in decision making.

However, PoS comes with some serious issues. First of all, there is the infamous "nothing at stake"
\cite{pos_flaws_nothing}
problem, which exploits the lack of any cost of the actual mining. In this case,
there is no downside to staking several branches simultaneously in case of a fork.

Ensuring that the source of entropy is distributed along the chain,
makes all of the elections entirely deterministic and predictable leading to a strategy
known commonly as "stake grinding," where the dishonest leader tries to rearrange the
transactions to influence the result of the upcoming election.

Next issue is the "long–range attack"\cite{pos_flaws_long}.
In the very beginning, the stake is scattered among a small
group of delegates that together have full control over the chain. After
some time, they can cooperate and start a concurrent chain diverging from
the main one. This could lead to nasty frauds and would
destabilize trust over the chain.

On the other hand, there are multiple approaches to deal with these problems. For instance,
to prevent nothing–at–stake, the CASPER protocol introduces a "wrong voting
penalty," which punishes
voters who support conflicting forks\cite{casper}.
However, this solution is backed by a finality gadget, which is located on another blockchain
anyway. NXT deals with long–range attack by forcefully
finalizing all blocks that are older than 720 generations\cite{nxt}.
One must note that this doesn't actually solve the problem, but rather defers
it. Moreover, it introduces weak subjectivity since one still needs to trust
some entity while entering the network for the first time or after a longer
downtime. Ouroboros staking system has managed to reach solid security, but
at the cost of very high complexity\cite{ouroboros}.

These are only a few examples. The general point is that PoS comes with many
problems, which, as they are being solved, eventually introduce some new ones. This
makes most of the pure PoS networks unreliable, and especially not as reliable
as mature PoWs.
