\section{Conclusion}

The proposed solution makes it possible to conveniently create simple, customizable, and most
importantly, secure blockchains. The idea of reusing the existing mining power
of other networks allows not only small chains to stay safe, but also
prevents massive energy waste and, therefore, is much more friendly to the environment.
Hyperchains can be utilized in extremely flexible ways. They can be created and
maintained almost for free and in case of network overload, they can serve as
parent chains for other nested child chains. We leave many implementational
details up to the hyperchains creators, because we find them highly
useâ€“case dependent.
