\section{Conclusion}

The proposed solution makes it possible to conveniently create simple, customizable, and most
important – secured blockchains. The idea of reusing the existing mining power
of other networks allows not only small chains to stay safe, but also
prevents massive energy waste and, therefore, becomes much more friendly for the environment.
Hyperchains can be utilized in extremely flexible ways – they can be created and
maintained almost for free and in case of network overload they can serve as
parent chains for other nested child chains. We left a lot of implementational
details to be defined by the hyperchains creators, because we find them highly
use-case dependent.
