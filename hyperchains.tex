\section{Hyperchains design}
\graphicspath{ {./images/} }

We present a hybrid strategy that benefits from the stability of PoW solutions
but offers the scalability of PoS systems. A \emph{hyperchain}, as originally
described by Yanislav Malahov\cite{hyperchains}, is a special kind of blockchain
that sticks to an already existing chain. They are going to be called child and
parent chain, respectively.

The parent chain can be almost any arbitrary blockchain. In general, we want to
use some big existing PoW based chains (at the time of writing, preferably
Bitcoin or Litecoin) to reuse their burned work to maintain the stability of the
child chain. We also propose a PoS-like election system to choose leaders on the
hyperchain. In this case, however, we employ a reliable and, most importantly,
unpredictable source of randomness, which is the state of the parent chain. The
idea is not absolutely novel, as there already exists research into this
topic\cite{blockchain_random}.

Following that, it feels natural to start a new election each time a (key)block
is mined on the parent chain. The next leader shall be chosen depending on the
hash of that block and selected with chances proportional to their stake. The
selection algorithm is abstract over this document---it is up to the hyperchain
to define the details.

We define a group of leadership candidates called "delegates." Each delegate
needs to express their will of participation in the upcoming election by
publishing a commitment transaction onto the parent chain. It is important that
they clearly declare their view of the child chain and over which block they are
going to compete. Therefore, the commitment must consist of:

\begin{itemize}
\item The subject of delegation on the child chain
\item The block hash over which the delegate is going to build
\item Signature of the delegate from the child chain
\end{itemize}

One of the concepts key to the commitment idea is to be able to rely on the
parent chain's stability. We want to treat it as a rigid skeleton of the
hyperchain, which can be achieved by proper block linking. The elected leader
shall be required to publish the key block on the child chain with a
cryptographic proof (referencing the parent) of their right to lead the upcoming
generation and publish micro blocks.

One dilemma that rises at this point is whether the commitment should reference
the latest key block or micro block of the child chain. Referencing a micro
block may feel more transparent, but we believe that it would lead to massive
forking (especially when some peers would not receive all of the blocks). One
must also consider the parent network's throughput. It may be impossible to fit
such a huge amount of commitments if we let delegates compete over each micro
block.

The problem with referencing a key block is that the next leader could steal the
transactions and post them in their micro blocks. This, however, can be resolved
with a smarter feeing strategy. For instance, instead of giving the full fee to
the miner, we can split it up and give the bigger part to the next leader who
did include the previous leader's micro blocks in their continuation of the
history, as it happens in the BitcoinNG\cite{incentive_bcng}. Following their
election, the new leader posts a key block on the child chain, which references
the commitment on the parent, thus proving their right to lead the generation.
Besides that, they need to reference the micro block from the previous
generation, on which they want to mine.
