\textbf{TO BE REBUILT}

One of the most important problems that blockchains need to tackle in order to
maintain a consistent and safe infrastructure is the need for a decentralized and
unpredictible randomness generator. Proof of Work (PoW) solutions are
traditionally the most popular ones. They achieve network security by burning
(usually empty) CPU cycles. The assumption is that no single entity has over 51\%
of the computing power of the network to affect the randomness for their own
benefits. This is a slow and costly process that relies on having
a vast and decentralized network of miners. Proof of Stake (PoS) on the other
hand is much more energy efficient but its implementation details matter
greatly. It could be subject to the nothing-at-stake problem or stake grinding and
thus eventually degrade to an inelegant PoW solution.

We propose a hybrid approach between the two: we build a PoS system that
relies on an existing PoW network for providing security. The security of the
PoW network itself is outside of the scope of this document: this is up to
the specific hyperchain setup to choose a secure PoW network to use as it
can never be as secure as the PoW chain. It is worth noting that it should
be possible to change the PoW system the Hyperchain is using further down
in its lifetime. We will call the PoW chain a parent chain and the PoS system
- a child chain.
