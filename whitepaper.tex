\begin{abstract}

The blockchain relies on consensus between miners. A well known problem is that the block producer should not be known in advance as this opens the possibilities for malicious actors. A solution as old as Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper is that this must be a random event. This should also be an open, transparent and provable process but also a fair one. There are different approaches for achieving this and they all have their perks and flaws. We propose a hybrid between a Proof of Work and Proof of Stake.
