\section{Derived issues}

While the presented idea seems to cover the majority of cases, some
scenarios may break the system's stability. However, depending on the
chosen parent chain and the tweaks of inner protocol, their impact
can be limited to an acceptable risk.

\subsection{Forks of the parent}

Whatever happens to the parent, the similar shall happen to the child. The child
chain is entirely vulnerable to forks of the parent chain, and it is quite hard
to agree about on which branch to continue. Most likely, the
hyperchain would fork as well. On the other hand, if the validators manage to
decide on one branch, it would be technically possible to jump into the other
if the chosen one becomes less attractive.

\subsection{Attacks on the parent}

The hyperchain can never be more secure than the parent.
If somebody succeeds in a 51\% attack on the parent chain,
they will also take control of the child chain.
Therefore the choice of the parent should be made with regards to its security.

\subsection{Finalization time}

Since there is no single correct strategy on how to react to forks, the
finalization time shall not be shorter on a hyperchain than on the parent chain.
If the parent key block gets rolled back, so will all of the leader elections.
